################# Configuration for LLDAP #####################

# The LDAP host, Adding a port is optional
LDAP_SERVER=ldap://lldap:3890

# If using LDAP over SSL you should also define the protocol:
# LDAP_SERVER=ldaps://example.com:636

# The base DN from where users will be dk within
LDAP_BASE_DN=ou=people,dc=domain,dc=example

# The full DN and password of the user used to search the server
# Can both be left as false to bind anonymously
LDAP_DN=uid=readonly_user,ou=people,dc=domain,dc=example
LDAP_PASS=

# A filter to use when searching for users
# The user-provided user-name used to replace any occurrences of '${user}'
# If you're setting this option via other means, such as within a docker-compose.yml,
# you may need escape the $, often using $$ or \$ instead.
LDAP_USER_FILTER=(&(uid=${user})(memberOf=cn=bookstack-reader,ou=groups,dc=domain,dc=example))

# Set the LDAP version to use when connecting to the server
# Should be set to 3 in most cases.
LDAP_VERSION=3

# Set the property to use as a unique identifier for this user.
# Stored and used to match LDAP users with existing BookStack users.
# Prefixing the value with 'BIN;' will assume the LDAP service provides the attribute value as

# Set the attribute to use for the user's avatar image.
# Must provide JPEG binary image data.
# Will be used upon login or registration when the user doesn't
# already have an avatar image set.
# Remove this option or set to 'null' to disable LDAP avatar import.

LDAP_THUMBNAIL_ATTRIBUTE=jpegphoto

# Force TLS to be used for LDAP communication.
# Use this if you can but your LDAP support will need to support it and
# you may need to import your certificate to the BookStack host machine.
# Defaults to 'false'.
LDAP_START_TLS=false

# If you need to allow untrusted LDAPS certificates, add the below and uncomment (remove the #)
# Only set this option if debugging or you're absolutely sure it's required for your setup.
